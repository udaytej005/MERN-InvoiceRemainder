1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/udaytej005/MERN-InvoiceRemainder.git

Navigate to the repository directory:
cd MERN-InvoiceRemainder

2. Install Dependencies
The repository has two parts:
Backend (Node.js/Express)
Frontend (React)

Install Backend Dependencies:
Navigate to the backend folder (if the structure is backend/):
cd backend

Install dependencies:
npm install

Install Frontend Dependencies:
Navigate to the frontend folder (if the structure is frontend/):
cd ../frontend


Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create .env files for the backend and frontend as required.

Backend .env:
Create a .env file inside the backend folder:
cd ../backend
touch .env


Add the following variables to the file (replace placeholders with actual values): 
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=5000
If you are using a cloud MongoDB service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas), replace MONGO_URI with your connection string.


Start the Application
----------------------
Start Backend Server:
Run the following command in the backend directory:
npm start

Start Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd ../frontend

Run the following command to start the React development server:
npm start


Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the frontend.
The backend API should be available at http://localhost:5000 or your specified port.

Troubleshooting
````````````````
If the backend server fails to connect to MongoDB, ensure your MongoDB service is running and the MONGO_URI is correct.

If there are port conflicts, update the PORT in .env or use environment variables during runtime:
PORT=8000 npm start
For detailed logs, check the terminal output of both servers.
